				<p class="editable">New York is one of the most expensive cities in the country but also is home to some of the richest and poorest families in the US. As temporary waves of the coronavirus infections continue to temporarily cripple the economy in ways that disproportionately affect "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/business/coronavirus-recession-equality/">low-wage, minority workers</a>," this chasm between the haves and have-nots will only become more pronounced.</p>

				<p>Our data journalism class decided document one of the most pressing issues for a lot of New York's low-income families during the fall of 2021: housing. Our stories focus on bogged-down governmental aid programs, housing insecurity and gentrification trends. You can read them on the various pages of this website.</p>
